## Getting Started
To begin using airbnbclone, you have two options: downloading the zipped file or cloning the repository. Once you have done so, navigate to the root directory and run the command "npm install" to install the necessary dependencies.

To start the backend server, enter the "backend" directory, run "npm install" to install its dependencies, and then execute "npm start". After the backend server is up and running, exit the backend directory and enter the "frontend" directory. Once there, run "npm install" to install the frontend's dependencies and execute "npm start" to start the frontend application.

By following these simple steps, you will be able to fully experience airbnbclone and all it has to offer.
